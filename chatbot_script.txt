Hi, how can I assist you today?
I'm interested in learning a new language. Can you suggest one?
Of course. I here to help you with Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French lessons. Which one would you choose?
The easiest.
Maybe you should start with Spanish. Its pronunciation is easy and straightforward, which is a big plus beside its simple grammar. Spanish is also widely used across the Latin world, which help you gain a lot of job opportunities.
Thanks for the recommendation. How should I started?
First you should learn basic words such as "el agua", "la leche", "el hombre", "la mujer", followed by greeting phrases such as "Hola!", "Qué tal?" or "Buenas días!".
This sounds good. Do you recommend any online practice sources?
You should seek SpanishDict.com, Spanish101, or give Duolingo a shot.
Thanks for your help!
You're welcome. Let me know if you have any other questions.
